# Exercise 1: Data Gathering, Prepping & Cleaning

We will be working with letters from the Founder's Archive website -- the [Hamilton Papers](https://founders.archives.gov/search/Project:%22Hamilton%20Papers%22). 

## Gather Files
1. Download two sets of folders: 
    * [hamilton-all-letters](https://github.com/sduke/Collections-As-Data-Voyant/blob/master/hamilton-all-letters.zip) (compressed files)
    * [hamilton-all-letters_clean](https://github.com/sduke/Collections-As-Data-Voyant/blob/master/hamilton-all-letters_clean.zip)(compressed files)

2. Save both folders to Desktop for each access

* **If on a Windows machine**, you may need to uncompress the folder before you can open the individual text files. 

## Prepare Files
### Open Files in Text Editor 
1. Launch the Oxygen XML Editor (blue icon with red X).
    * X-out of the zillions of windows.
 2. In the top menu, select Project => New Project
 3. In the pop-up Box: 
   3. Select the folder on your Desktop: **hamilton-all-letters** 
   3. Rename the Project from "newProject.xpr" to "hamilton.xpr". 
 4. Save new Project, "hamilton.xpr," to Desktop 
 
 ### Review Files in Text Editor
